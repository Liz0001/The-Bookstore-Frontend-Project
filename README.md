6. The following book titles should be among the titles “Responsive design with Bootstrap”, “HTML - an introduction”, “CSS - an introduction” and “JavaScript - an introduction”. For these titles their should be a description that is a short summary of what you know about the respective area (in around 300 words). Do not copy these texts - write them in your own words!

7. For the remaining books you should use ‘Lorem Ipsum’ text for your description.

8. Their should be a list of all books that you can filter by category, by author and by price interval (one filter at a time) and that you can sort by title (ascending), title (descending), price (ascending) and price (descending), author (ascending) and author (descending).
